# BoredomRouletteV2
An app for randomized things to do when you're bored (something I'm sure many people feel right now.)
Offers sorted options for inside, outside, when you're alone, and when you have more than one person with you.
Also includes a section for creating your own roulette and getting random selections from that roulette.
Created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
